Family,
This December 24th is a big one—I’m turning 60! And I’m so grateful that we’ll all be together in San Diego to celebrate not only my birthday and Christmas, but also the Mexican culture that has shaped so much of who I am.
So get ready, because we’re having a Very Mexican Christmas this year!
We’ll have tamales steaming, ceviche chilling, and green mole simmering—plus enough tequila to keep the singing loud and the stories even louder. We’ll break out the Mexican Lotería cards, and Mexican train dominos and Sis start practicing the Mexican hat dance 
I requested a Mexican Santa to make a special trip from Mexico to surprise us .
And of course, we’ll keep one of our most beloved traditions: gathering together on Christmas Eve to watch It’s a Wonderful Life, and yes, due to popular demand I will add my narration.
I am especially looking forward to the delicious side dish’s the cousins will create and smoking a cigar by the fire at night 
With my Irish half cheering from the sidelines and all of you bringing your own sparkle, I know this will be a celebration full of love, laughter, and memories we’ll talk about for years.
Can’t wait to see you all for our Muy Mexicana Navidad!
Con mucho cariño,
