# Andre Daniel Paredes, PhD

Personal website and digital workspace at [adparedes.github.io](https://adparedes.github.io)

## About This Site

This is my corner of the internet—part professional portfolio, part personal laboratory. I use this space to share my work in clinical data science and AI strategy, but also to document learning journeys, coordinate family projects, and experiment with ideas that interest me.

### What You'll Find Here

**Professional Work**
- Clinical AI platforms and rare disease research initiatives
- Speaking engagements and publications
- Technical expertise in healthcare informatics

**Personal Projects & Learning**
- Family coordination sites (like vacation planning for my father-in-law's 60th)
- Explorations in history and ancient civilizations
- Biblical history and textual studies
- Whatever else I'm curious about at the moment

**Technical Experiments**
- Interactive maps and data visualizations
- Clean HTML/CSS implementations
- Tools that solve real problems

## Philosophy

I believe professional excellence and personal curiosity aren't separate lives to balance—they're the same life fully lived. This site reflects that integration.

## Technical Approach

- Pure HTML/CSS (intentionally minimal)
- Responsive, mobile-first design
- Progressive enhancement
- Open source and transparent
